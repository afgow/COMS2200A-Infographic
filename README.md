# COMS2200A-Infographic

**COMS 2200A Final Project (Fall 2017)**

You will produce an informative, relevant, accurate, purposeful, fun, and creative infographic on a topic related to Big Data and Society.  We will look at many examples in-class and do exercises to get you ready. You can discuss a process, phenomenon, findings in the data, compare things, show a dataset flowline, tell a story with a dataset, unpack the pieces of a dataset, abstract a scientific paper into an infographic, and you can even map out the OSM assignment etc. It can be digital or it can be done by hand.
